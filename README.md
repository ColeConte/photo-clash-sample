This is some sample code from a past iOS project called PhotoClash.
The goal of the project was to provide a social platform for users in the same area to share competing photos.
Some of the elements included in this sample code include:
  - User profile and search
  - Integration with Facebook SDK
  - Main feed
  
This was a fun challenge that taught me a lot about the features of Swift and required me to integrate a variety of libraries. I also learned a lot about UI design!
