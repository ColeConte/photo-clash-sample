This is some sample code from an iOS project I've been working on called PhotoClash.
The eventual goal of the project is to provide a platform for users in the same area to share competing photos.
Users can view past "clashes" and vote on current ones.
I picked a few of the more complete elements of the project to sample.
The design for the main screen is shown, where users will vote on clashes.
The design for the user profile page is also shown, along with a user search feature.
I integrated the app with the Facebook SDK to make it easy to sign up and find your friends.
I did not include the photo-editing portion of the app, which is in earlier stages than the other portions.
I am working on a mock version of Snapchat's photo editing screen to start.
I'm using CIFilters and gesture recognizers to simulate the Snapchat editing environment.

Clearly this is an unfinished project at this stage, but I hope it satisfies as a sample of my abilities.
